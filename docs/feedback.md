Hmmmm I would add a phone number in the heading with your name and email
I would also change the formatting of the experience section to match each other
For the Leadership/Skills/Awards part, I would move the more applicable stuff to the top (programming, excel, etc) and then push the less applicable stuff (NHS, Band, etc) to the end :)
